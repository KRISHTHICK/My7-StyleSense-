## 🎯 Project Title: **StyleSense - Fashion Mood Analyzer & Outfit Matcher**

### 🧵 Overview:

StyleSense is an AI-powered app that detects the **mood of an outfit** from a fashion photo (e.g., bold, elegant, casual) and **suggests complementary outfits or accessories**. It uses computer vision + LLM for creative matching and is ideal for influencers, stylists, or fashion e-commerce platforms.

2. AI extracts visual keywords and style elements.
3. LLM interprets the mood (e.g., “cozy autumn look”).
4. Suggests matching accessories, shoes, or layers.
5. Generates stylish Instagram captions & hashtags.
